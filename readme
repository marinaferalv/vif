CALCULATE_VIF Compute Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for variables in a linear regression model.

  Notes:
      The VIF of a variable measures how much the variance of the regression coefficients is inflated due to multicollinearity with other variables.
      A VIF greater than 5 or 10 is often considered indicative of problematic multicollinearity.

  Use:
      vif_values = calculate_vif(X) computes the VIF for each variable in a linear regression model represented by the matrix X.

  Inputs:
      X: A table or matrix where each column represents an independent variable in the regression model.
         If a variable X1 is continuous (double), you should transform it to cell: num2cell(X1(:,1)
         If a variable X2 is categorical (cell), you should transform keep it: X2(:,1) 
         X = cell2table([X1,X2],'VariableNames',{'X1','X2'})

  Outputs:
      vif_values: A vector containing the VIF values corresponding to each variable in the regression model.

  Notes: if you want to calculate the VIF of the interaction term of several variables, use calculate_interaction_terms,
      to add the to the variable's table. Example:
            interaction_terms=[var1name,var2name];
                    [int_result, int_names] = calculate_interaction(table_vars, interaction_terms);
                    table_varsX=[table_vars,cell2table(num2cell(int_result(:,1:end-1)),'VariableNames',int_names(1:end-1,1))]; % add all minus 1 to avoid absolute correlation between levels of the same variable
